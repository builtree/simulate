A Lissajous curve in mathematics, also known as Lissajous Figure or Bowditch curve is the
graphical representation of the following system of parametric equations.</p>

<center>
$x = A sin(at + δ)$  
$y = B sin(bt)$
</center>
  
These curves/patterns are highly sensitive to the values of $a$ and $b$, particularly to the ratio
$a:b$. For a ratio of $1$, and $δ = \frac{π}{2} radians$, the figure is a *circle*. Similarly, for $a = b$ and $δ = 0$, the figure is a *line*.  
Another simple Lissajous figure is the *parabola* $(\frac{b}{a} = 2, δ = \frac{π}{4})$.

!!! tip  "Fun Fact"
    The title sequence by John Whitney for Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 film Vertigo is based on Lissajous figures.
