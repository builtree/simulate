A Lissajous curve in mathematics, also known as Lissajous Figure or Bowditch curve is the
graphical representation of the following system of parametric equations.</p>

<center>
$x = A sin(at + δ)$  
$y = B sin(bt)$
</center>
  
These curves/patterns are highly sensitive to the values of $‘a’$ and $‘b’$, particularly to the ratio
$a:b$.  
For a ratio of $1$, and $δ = \frac{π}{2} radians$, the figure is a *circle*. Similarly, for $a = b$ and $δ = 0$, the figure is a *line*.
Another simple Lissajous figure is the *parabola* $(\frac{b}{a} = 2, δ = \frac{π}{4})$.

Lissajous curves can also be generated using an oscilloscope. An octopus circuit can be used
to demonstrate the waveform images on an oscilloscope. Two phase-shifted sinusoid inputs are
applied to the oscilloscope in X-Y mode and the phase relationship between the signals is
presented as a Lissajous figure. For convenience, the values of $‘A’$ and $‘B’$ are equal and
constant in the app. A beautiful animation of how the pattern is drawn is also available.

!!! tip  "Fun Fact"
    The title sequence by John Whitney for Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 film Vertigo is based on Lissajous figures.
