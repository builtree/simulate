| Bubble Sort (Bars) | Algorithms | Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list by comparing adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order | ![Bubble Sort](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/builtree/simulate/master/assets/simulations/BubbleSortLight.png) |
| Epicycloid Pattern(Pencil of Lines) | Mathematics | a.k.a hypercycloid, is a plane curve created by tracing a chosen point on the edge of a circle of radius r rolling on the outside of a circle of radius R | ![Epicycloid Pattern](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/builtree/assets/simulate/icons/Epicycloid1Light.png) |
| Epicycloid Curve | Mathematics | a.k.a hypercycloid, is a plane curve created by tracing a chosen point on the edge of a circle of radius r rolling on the outside of a circle of radius R | ![Epicycloid Curve](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/builtree/assets/simulate/icons/EpicycloidLight.png) |
| [Fourier Series](mathematics/FourierSeries.md) | Mathematics | A Fourier series is an expansion of a periodic function in terms of an infinite sum of sines and cosines | ![Fourier Series](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/builtree/assets/simulate/icons/FourierSeriesLight.png) |
| Insertion Sort (Bars) | Algorithms | Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that builds the final list one item at a time | ![Insertion Sort](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/builtree/simulate/master/assets/simulations/InsertionSortLight.png) |
| [Lissajous Pattern](mathematics/LissajousPattern.md)| Mathematics | Lissajous pattern is generated by the junction of a pair of sinusoidal waves with axes that are perpendicular to one another |![Lissajous Pattern](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/builtree/assets/simulate/icons/LissajousCurveLight.png) |
| [Maurer Rose Pattern](mathematics/MaurerRosePattern.md) | Mathematics | A Maurer Rose is a polygonal curve with vertices on a rose and can be described as a closed route in the polar plane | ![MaurerRose Pattern](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/builtree/assets/simulate/icons/MaurerRoseLight.png) |
| Rose Pattern | Mathematics | A Rose pattern is generated by the junction of sinusoids plotted in polar coordinates | ![Rose Pattern](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/builtree/assets/simulate/icons/RosePatternLight.png) |
| [Toothpick Pattern](algorithms/ToothpickPattern.md) | Algorithms | A Toothpick pattern is a sequence of 2D patterns formed by repeatedly adding line segments or _toothpicks_ to the previous pattern in the sequence. It starts with a single line segment | ![Toothpick Pattern](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/builtree/simulate/master/assets/simulations/ToothpickPatternLight.png) |
