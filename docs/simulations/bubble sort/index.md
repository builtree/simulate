# Bubble Sort

Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm. Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform

### Time complexity of Buuble Sort:
- Worst Case Time Complexity : O(n^2)
- Best Case Time Complexity : O(n) when the elements are already sorted.
- Average Time Complexity : O(n^2)

Here n is the number of elements being sorted.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity of an algorithm or a computer program is the amount of memory space required to solve an instance of the computational problem as a function of the size of the input. It is the memory required by an algorithm to execute a program and produce output.

### Space complexity of Buuble Sort:
- Space Complexity: O(1)
