Welcome to Simulate! Simulate aims to be a collection of simulations and visualizations from various domains like mathematics, physics, computer science etc. in a cross platform app made using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). The outcomes of these simulations mostly are really smooth (thanks to Flutter) and extremely beautiful (thanks to mathematics/sciences behind it).
