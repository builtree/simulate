## Setting Up Docs

1. Install mkdocs and its requirements
```bash
python3 -m  pip install mkdocs pymdown-extensions mkdocs-material
```
2. Check the installations by:
```bash
mkdocs --version
```

    !!! warning ""
        If this doesn't work, try restarting the terminal

3. Use the below command to host the documentation on local server
```bash
mkdocs serve --dev-addr 127.0.0.1:8000
```
{== MkDocs supports live reload so you don't have to run the server again and again. Just make your changes in the docs and you'll see the change immediately. ==}
4. All the documentation is present in the `docs` directory.
