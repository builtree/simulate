# Simulate 
[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/codEd-org/simulate.svg)](https://gitter.im/codEd-org/simulate?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

Collection of simulations and visualizations in a cross platform app made using Flutter. Cross-platform development is the ability to build and deliver apps that can run across multiple device platforms, such as iOS, Android, and the Universal Windows Platform. The application displays a variety of simulation to understand the concepts visually.

# Installaton

This application works on Flutter, Google's UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications from a single codebase which uses purely Dart here in the project.

1) Make sure you have Flutter installed (https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
2) Do not forget to connect your personal device or vitural device on whichever platform you are working from
3) Run any test applications to check if it is working or not
4) Clone the repository and download and run it on your local machine
