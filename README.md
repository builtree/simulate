Welcome to Simulate! Simulate is a collection of simulations and visualizations from various domains like mathematics, physics, computer science etc. in a cross platform app made using Flutter. The outcomes of these simulations mostly are really smooth (thanks to Flutter) and extremely beautiful (thanks to mathematics/sciences behind it). You can take a peek [here](https://cod-ed.github.io/simulate/simulations).
